- 👋 Hi, I’m @KLT1234
- 
- 👀 I have always had an interest in computer science and programming. In my teens I started with HTML and making homepages. I developed a genuine interest in 
- that area. For many different reasons, life took a different turn and I ended up with a academic degree within a completly different area. My interest for 
- computers and programming has always been there though. Since some time back I have decided to persue my interest and am there for learning to program again.
- I have on an intelectual level not been this happy for many years! 
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript and a little bit C# together with my son.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking for more knowledge! Any help or tip I can get along the way is much appreciated. 
- 
- 📫 How to reach me ... on github for now.
